ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;  # Specifies the SSL/TLS protocols to be used. TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 are the most secure and modern protocols, providing robust encryption.
ssl_ciphers 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';  # Defines the cipher suites for SSL/TLS. These prioritize strong encryption, forward secrecy, and authenticated encryption (AES-GCM).
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;  # Configures the server to prioritize its preferred cipher order over the clientâ€™s, ensuring the use of secure ciphers.
ssl_session_timeout 10m;  # Sets the SSL session timeout duration. Sessions that remain idle for over 10 minutes will need to renegotiate, balancing performance and security.
