proxy_ssl on;  # Enables SSL/TLS for connections to the upstream server, ensuring encrypted communication.
proxy_ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;  # Specifies the supported SSL/TLS protocols for secure upstream connections. Only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 are allowed for enhanced security.
proxy_ssl_ciphers 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';  # Defines the set of ciphers used for SSL/TLS handshakes, prioritizing secure and modern cipher suites.
proxy_ssl_session_reuse on;  # Enables SSL session reuse to optimize performance by reusing established SSL sessions for repeated connections to the upstream server.
proxy_ssl_server_name on;  # Enables sending the Server Name Indication (SNI) in the SSL handshake, allowing the upstream server to serve the correct certificate for virtual hosts.
