proxy_ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;  # Specifies the SSL/TLS protocols supported by the proxy for upstream connections. Only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 are enabled for security.
proxy_ssl_ciphers 'EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';  # Defines the cipher suites for SSL connections. These are strong ciphers that prioritize forward secrecy and AES encryption.
proxy_ssl_session_reuse on;  # Enables SSL session reuse for upstream connections, improving performance by avoiding renegotiation of SSL handshakes for repeated connections.
proxy_ssl_server_name on;  # Enables the `Server Name Indication` (SNI) extension, allowing the proxy to specify the hostname to the upstream server during the SSL handshake.
